Improvements to application (for discussion):

- add gitignore
- add dockerignore
- build app image from docker
- write migration in sql without using knex client (extra layer source of errors)
- build app when files change without stopping executable
- api response should be wrapped in body (Express doesn't by default)
- split routes in different files and same for testing
- to properly test endpoints, query db to check that posted event has actually been written to db as expected
